# Developing in Swift with VS Code Dev Containers

Sample project for the series of articles about using Swift with Dev Containers in VS Code.

* 1st Article: [Developing in Swift with VS Code Dev Containers](https://swifttoolkit.dev/posts/dev-containers-swift). To follow the post after cloning, check out the [**starter**](https://github.com/SwiftToolkit/dev-containers/tree/starter) branch.

* 2nd Article: [Using Postgres with Hummingbird in a Dev Container](https://swifttoolkit.dev/posts/dev-containers-postgres). To follow the post, start from the [**simple-container**](https://github.com/SwiftToolkit/dev-containers/tree/simple-container) branch.

The final branch, which will be used in the the 3rd and final article, is the [**postgres**](https://github.com/SwiftToolkit/dev-containers/tree/postgres) branch.

This repository is based on the [todos-postgres-tutorial](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird-examples/tree/main/todos-postgres-tutorial) sample project, with some modifications, from the [Hummingbird Examples](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird-examples) repository.
